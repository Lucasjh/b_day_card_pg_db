<h2>Check out the new track, Grace!</h2>

<p>
	Welcome to GraceFace Alpha (0.5), the social network for Lucas to practice his web dev skillz, at Grace. In coming releases additional functionality may or may not be built in. Once we approach beta (1.0) or even a production release (2.0), the dev team member(s) may decide to change the user interface strategy into the form of a mobile app, or even leave the user a voicemail. (barring the possiblity of a seafood date night...)   For the time being, the user of this network can enjoy a variety of digital media for her entertainment pleasure.
